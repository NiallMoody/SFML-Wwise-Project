# SFML Wwise Project Notes

This project provides a basic Wwise implementation integrated into an SFML
project. The audio code is not at all tied to SFML though; the same approach can
be used with any C++ project/framework (e.g. SDL, skateboard, etc.).

The integration follows the official Audiokinetic guidance at this link:
https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/public-library/2025.1.5_9095/?source=SDK&id=workingwithsdks.html

There were a few idiosyncracies to the integration that were not listed in the
official docs, you can compare the code in `WwiseWrapper` to the official docs
to see what's different.

Note that `WwiseWrapper` provides just the barebones of a Wwise integration. You
will likely need to extend it to make it work for your purposes.

## Visual Studio Project Settings
Setting up your Visual Studio project to work with Wwise is similar to using any
external library: you will need to set the **Additional Include Directories** to
point to your Wwise SDK `include` folder, the **Additional Libraries
Directories** to point to the appropriate SDK `lib` folder (note there are
separate libraries for Debug and Release versions), and you will need to include
the following libraries:

|------------------------|----------|
|Library				 |Debug Only|
|------------------------|----------|
|AkSoundEngine.lib		 |			|
|AkMemoryMgr.lib		 |			|
|AkStreamMgr.lib		 |			|
|AkSpatialAudio.lib		 |			|
|AkMusicEngine.lib		 |			|
|CommunicationCentral.lib|Yes		|
|wsock32.lib			 |Yes		|
|------------------------|----------|

You will also want to add `AK_OPTIMIZED` to the **Preprocessor Definitions** for
the release build.

## SoundEngine Folder
By default, Wwise expects you to implement a lot of file I/O and memory handling
yourself. Audiokinetic provide a reference implementation however. These files
are included in the **SoundEngine** folder.
